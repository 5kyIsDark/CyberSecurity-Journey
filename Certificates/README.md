# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Certificates & Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository showcasing my cybersecurity certifications and learning milestones. I‚Äôm a 15-year-old passionate about ethical hacking and network security, actively building a strong foundation in cybersecurity through practical learning platforms like TryHackMe.

So far, I‚Äôve completed the Pre-Security and Networking Essentials rooms on TryHackMe, where I‚Äôve gained a solid understanding of how computer networks operate, from IP addressing and DNS to the OSI and TCP/IP models. Through this, I‚Äôve also built confidence navigating both Linux and Windows-based systems using the terminal, command prompt, and PowerShell.

This repo serves as a growing portfolio of my learning journey ‚Äî including certifications I've earned, and eventually, the tools I‚Äôll gain hands-on experience with like Nmap, Wireshark, and more. It reflects my dedication to self-learning and my commitment to pursuing cybersecurity seriously at a young age.

All certification badges and PDFs are stored in the `/certificates/` folder.
